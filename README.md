# SaladHR Sustainability and Waste Management Tools (SUSWAT)

SaladHR offers sustainability and waste management tools tailored for restaurants and food businesses. Our web application, SUSWAT, is designed to help users track their environmental impact and incentivize sustainable practices.

Features
Our web app incentivizes sustainable practices through a token-based reward system. Users earn green tokens based on a simple formula: input minus output over input. This means the tokens they receive depend on how much they've contributed compared to what they've used up.
